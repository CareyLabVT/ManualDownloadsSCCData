This is a description of where the MiniDot was deployed and why. 

Deployed by: Adrienne Breef-Pilz, Whitney Woelmer, and Dexter Howard

Deployment: 2022-12-12 to 2023-04-12

Site: Falling Creek Reservoir, Vinton, VA. Site 40 or 45 right where the reservoir starts to narrow. About 37.304167, -79.838333

Why: The sensor was deployed from a concrete flower part about 0.5m off the bottom to capture oxygen dynamics at a shallow part of the reservoir close to the inflow from the weir


Second Deployment: 2023-12-04 to 2023-03-25

Site: Same as above

Comments: When recovered sensor it was underwater with a hole in the buoy. Looking at the data, it seems the sensor was in the water from 21 Jan 2024 onwards because DO is reading 0. Something to look at when using these data.
