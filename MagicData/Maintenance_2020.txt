24MAR20
Mux deployed at FCR using surface water rinse. Noticed skips in program and measurement recording but not anything that should effect depths data.

27MAR20
Sensor field day troubleshooting mux. Autoreset did not work on 26MAR20. Skipping recording measurements for Valve 9 aka acid. Pumping slow or not working at all at certain depths. Flushed peristaltic tubing out in mux which seemed to work enough to leave the mux on.

30MAR20
Manual pumping tests. Slow pumping again tried flushing tubing. Still pumping enough to record data so mux left on.

1APR20
Mux pump is officially dead.

4APR20
Pump found completely dead but did not have supplies to troubleshoot reason. Mux left off.

7APR20
1.6m scan from mux deployed on chain in reservoir on spare con::nect. Pump checked again and was still dead.

10APR20
Deployed new scan at 4.5m in the reservoir connected and logging data through the mux. Downloaded 1.6m scan. Both sondes are on chain. Presumed cleaning of both scans.

13APR20
Sensor downloads of scan at 1.6m and mux scan at 4.5m. Mux logs appear normal and to have reset properly everyday. Water level very high. 

20APR2020
Sensor downloads of scan at 1.6m and mux scan at 4.5m. Pulled scans out of water to clean 12:40-12:45 EDT. No major fouling detected on lenses though cleaning cloth looked slightly silty after cleaning outside.

24APR20
Mux pump arrived. Deployed mux and started at 14:15 EDT. Data downloaded from scans. 4.5m scan was moved up to mux.

25APR20
Strange manual pumping noticed in pump log. Did not autoreset properly.

27APR20
Data downloaded from 1.6m scan and mux. Tried resetting scan attached to mux to help with autoreset and line up time of autoreset to occur when mux was not busy.

1MAY20
Data downloaded.

4MAY20
Data downloaded. Mux cuvette cleaned.

11MAY20
Data downloaded. 1.6m scan cleaned.

14MAY20
Data downloaded.

15MAY20
Steps 2 program deployed on mux. Stopped skipping measurements and autorest worked as expected. Program resulted in the mux only measuring to 17:00 after autoresets due to previously unknown pump number limits.

18MAY20
Data downloaded. No notes on cleaning scan on that field day but it was likely. Mux did not autoreset on 19MAY20.

25MAY20
Data download. 1.6m scan cleaned at 10:52. Steps 1 program put back on mux. Autoreset working.
