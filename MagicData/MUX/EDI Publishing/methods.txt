Data Collection
We monitored high-frequency light absorbance at multiple depths in FCR using a s::can Spectrolyser UV-Visible spectrophotometer (s::can Messtechnik GmbH, Vienna, Austria). This spectrophotometer was coupled with a multiplexor pumping system ('MUX' from MultiplexO, LLC; for technical details on the multiplexor pumping system and the sensor setup, refer to Birgand et al. 2016). The MUX pumps water samples from multiple depths into a flow-through cuvette where the UV-vis absorbance spectra of the sample are measured by the spectrophotometer. The system collected measurements of light absorbance every 2.5 nm wavelengths from 200 nm to 732.5 nm (optical path length of 10 mm) approximately at an hourly time step for seven monitoring depths in the reservoir. 
The MUX system was used to collect high-frequency data during two time periods: reservoir turnover ("Turnover Deployment") and the initiation of HOx operation ( "Oxygen On Deployment"). The Turnover Deployment captured the natural oxygenation and mixing processes that occurred during reservoir turnover and lasted from 16 October to 9 November 2020. During this time period the HOx system was on, so the hypolimnion was oxic before turnover, but the reservoir was thermally stratified. The Oxygen On Deployment was conducted between 26 May and 21 June 2021; during that time the HOx system was initiated on 11 June 2021 at 11:00 EDT. This deployment captured the engineered oxygenation and mixing processes resulting from the initiation of HOx operation. The reservoir was thermally-stratified and the hypolimnion was anoxic (DO < 1 mg/L) prior to HOx operation and thus, while HOx operation added oxygen to the hypolimnion, we observed a limited increase in DO concentrations due to high chemical oxygen demand. The HOx system induced internal mixing within the hypolimnion, but the overall thermal stratification of the reservoir was not affected. 
We took multiple steps to limit the influence of fouling of the internal components of the MUX system, due to precipitation of Fe in contact with oxygen in the measuring cuvette. Between each pump cycle, deionized water was flushed through the system. At the end of each pump sequence (one sample from each depth), dilute hydrochloric acid (5%) was automatically pumped through the system and allowed to sit in the flow-through cuvette for approximately 2 minutes. We also collected a reference measurement in air at the end of each cycle, which was useful in determining the extent of fouling. Despite these efforts, some fouling was still evident during certain time periods. Fouling was most pronounced in the lower wavelengths (200-250 nm) and therefore we removed values for wavelengths less than 250 nm before fitting PLSR models. 
Partial Least Squares Regression Modeling
We used PLSR to compute predictions of total and soluble Fe and Mn concentrations based on the correlation between absorbance spectra and sampling data. The Fe and Mn sampling dataset used for calibration, including methods for sample collection and analysis, can be found in Schreiber et al. (2022). Data analysis and QA/QC was performed in the R programming environment (R.v.4.2.1). Model building was conducted using the pls package (Mevik et al. 2020; R Core Team 2022).
The pls package has a built-in function for determining the number of model components based on the root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) using 10-fold cross validation (Mevik et al. 2020). The algorithm randomly chooses a subset of the data to be withheld for validation, while fitting the model to the rest of the data. This is repeated across 10 random segments and the RMSEP is computed for each component. RMSEP for each component is plotted against the number of components, and the number of components included in the final PLSR model is determined based on this curve. Generally, as the number of components increases, the RMSEP curve decreases sharply until reaching an inflection point where it plateaus. To avoid overfitting, we chose the number of components equal to this inflection point plus or minus one, or the global minimum of the curve, whichever resulted in the lowest number of components (following Etheridge et al. 2014, Birgand et al. 2016, and Mevik et al. 2020). Furthermore, it has been suggested that the number of components should not exceed 10% of the total number of observations used to calibrate the model (Mevik et al. 2020). We followed this rule to the greatest extent possible. In some cases, the number of components slightly exceeded the 10% requirement, but this only occurred when including an additional component would substantially decrease the RMSEP determined by 10-fold cross validation, while also improving the variance explained by the model. Given the sensitivity of the PLSR method, our approach was to optimize the tradeoff between model fit and predictive accuracy. Once the number of components was determined, the model was fit to the observational data and predictions were made using the high-frequency absorbance measurements. In some cases, PLSR predicted slightly negative concentration values. For the purposes of this analysis, we considered negative values to have a value of 0 mg/L for all variables, unless stated otherwise.
Calibration datasets were assessed for potential outliers using an ensemble approach implemented in the R package enpls (Xiao et al. 2019). For each model, an ensemble of 50 PLSR sub-models was generated using Monte Carlo resampling and the empirical predictive error distribution for each sample was used to identify outliers. Samples with a mean predictive error greater than 3 standard deviations from the mean predictive error for all samples or with a standard deviation greater than 3 times the mean standard deviation of all samples were considered potential outliers (Cao et al. 2017). However, we took a conservative approach and did not eliminate all samples that met this criteria, but rather only removed samples that were identified not only as outliers by the aforementioned method but also led to a deterioration of model fit, showed signs of sampling/analytical error, or were collected during times of cuvette fouling.
To assess the uncertainty of the predictions made using PLSR, we calculated nonparametric bootstrap predictive intervals following methods described by Denham (1997). To summarize, a model was first fit to the available observational data (Y) and absorbance spectra (X) using the predetermined number of components. This model was used to make predictions (E). Then, the residuals of the original model were randomly sampled and added to Y and E to obtain a new set of values for the dependent variable, denoted here as Y', and new predictions, denoted here as E'. A new model was fit to X and Y', and again used to make new predictions (E'). The prediction error was then calculated based on E' - E'. This process was repeated 1000 times to obtain the bootstrapped error distribution (G). We then calculated the 0.05 and 0.95 quantiles of G, which represented the 90% predictive intervals around the predictions from the original model (Denham 1997). Model skill was assessed using the coefficient of determination (R2) from the linear regression between predicted and observed values, as well as the root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) for each model (following Wold et al. 2001 and Mevik et al. 2020).
Separate PLSR models were developed for each deployment, variable (total Fe, soluble Fe, total Mn, and soluble Mn) and depth layer. Epilimnion models included data from 0.1, 1.6, and 3.8 m and hypolimnion models included data from 6.2, 8.0, and 9.0 m. Although we also collected data from 5.0 m, we did not include them in our analyses since this is at the transition between the two layers (metalimnion; see McClure et al. 2018) and thus not applicable to either layer. We developed separate models for the Turnover Deployment and the Oxygen On Deployment. In the end, we had four separate models for each of the four variables (total and soluble Fe and Mn), resulting in 16 different models.
